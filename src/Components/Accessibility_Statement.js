            <strong>Accessibility Features</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Skip to Main Content:</strong>Quick access to the core
            content on the page is provided without going through repetitive
            navigation using the keyboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Skip to Main Content:</strong> Quick access to the
            navigation pane is provided that enables accessing the different
            sections, such as Citizens, Government, and Directories.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Accessibility Options:</strong> Options to change the size
            of the text and set a colour scheme are provided. For example, if
            you are using a desktop to access this portal, the text might appear
            smaller on the screen that makes it difficult to read. In such a
            situation, you can use this option to increase the size of the text
            for clear visibility and better readability.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Descriptive Link Text:</strong> Brief description of a link
            is provided using descriptive phrases instead of just using words
            such as 'Read more' and 'Click here' as linked text. For example, if
            a link opens a PDF file, the description specifies its file size.
            Further, if a link opens a Web site in a new window, the description
            specifies the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Table Headers:</strong> The table headings are marked and
            associated with their corresponding cells in each row. For example,
            if there are 30 rows and 5 columns in a table, it is difficult for a
            user with visual disability to identify which data cell belongs to
            which header. In this situation, an assistive device such as a
            screen reader can read the column header of any cell for the user.
            In addition, captions are also specified for each table that act as
            labels and indicate what data is provided in the table.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Headings:</strong> The Web page content is organized using
            appropriate headings and subheadings that provide a readable
            structure. H1 indicates the main heading, whereas H2 indicates a
            subheading. In addition, for the screen reader users, there are
            hidden headings in this portal that are read out by a screen reader
            for better readability.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Titles:</strong> An appropriate name for each Web page is
            specified that helps you to understand the page content easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alternate Text:</strong> Brief description of an image is
            provided for users with visual disability. If you are using a
            browser that supports only text or have turned off the image
            display, you can still know what the image is all about by reading
            the alternate text in absence of an image.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Explicit Form Label Association:</strong> A label is linked
            to its respective control, such as text box, check box, radio
            button, and drop-down list. This enables the assistive devices to
            identify the labels for the controls on a form.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Consistent Navigation Mechanism: Consistent style of presentation
              throughout the portal is incorporated.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Keyboard Support:</strong> The portal can be browsed using a
            keyboard by pressing the Tab and Shift + Tab keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Customized Text Size:</strong> The size of the text on the
            Web page can be changed either through the browser or through the
            accessibility options feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript Independent: Web page information and functionalities are
            independent of JavaScript, irrespective of the browser support for
            the scripting language.
